# SmallD.kt
 SmallD.kt is a discord bot library which aims to provide a very usable and easy experience when handling discord bot creation. 
 It aims to abstract every resource, event, and request given by the discord docs into classes and functions. 
 The coroutines from kotlin come together to provide a seamless experience when dealing with the I/O of discord bot routing and requests. 
 This library wraps a lower level library so the maintenance of what it's meant to interact with is split into multiple repos; to not only lighten the load of what has to be concerned but also modularize handling of the different parts of the discord endpoint.
