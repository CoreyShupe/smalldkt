## Reporting a Bug
If you'd like to report a bug please submit an [issue](https://github.com/princesslana/smalldkt/issues) and patiently wait for a response to the bug.
## Suggesting a Feature
If you'd like to suggest a feature follow the same procedure as reporting a bug but use the proper template.
## Implementing a Feature or Fixing an Issue
If you're submitting code and implementing a feature or focusing on a specific issue then create a fork and submit a PR.
Please be descriptive in what your PR is meant to accomplish and how it accomplishes its goal.
